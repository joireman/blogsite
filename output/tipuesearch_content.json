{"pages":[{"title":"About Me","text":"I am passionate about creating high quality, testable and well documented software and enjoy working in a dynamic environment where others share this passion. I am a software engineer working on server side development for physIQ, Inc. a health technology startup. We are working to bring a novel medical device to market that combines remote monitoring of biosignals and predictive analytics to provide unique and useful information to clinicians and physicians. I use Python for back end development to process incoming biosignal data through various signal processing and machine learning algorithms. I have 12+ years of experience in all different phases of software development, architecture, design, implementation, testing and deployment. I have worked at many different levels from low level embedded hardware/software interfaces to multi-tiered web application implementation and deployment and am very comfortable moving between different levels of abstraction. I currently work almost exclusively with Python and appreciate its flexibility and the wide range of excellent packages, numpy/scipy, pandas, requests, flask, etc. I often turn to C/C++ when speed is at a premium or the environment requires it but I have experience with Java, Matlab, LabVIEW and assembly. I hold a PhD in Chemistry from UCLA and a BS/BA in Chemistry/Mathematics from Whitworth University. I taught chemistry for several years in such widely separated places as Ethiopia, England, rural Iowa and western NY state. In the late 90s I was bitten by the programming bug, first learning and loving C++. I jumped off the academic ship and into the \"real world\" and spent almost 10 years as and embedded programmer in the Accelerator Division at Fermi National Accelerator Lab, using C/C++, Python, LabVIEW and MATLAB. In 2011, I moved from the large corporate environment of Fermilab to a small startup working on innovative uses of wearable sensors and predictive analytics to improve health care. In 2017, a family move took me to Richmond, VA, where I currently work for Capital One.
